"""
MVC ROLE: MODEL — represents the shopping cart and its line items.
DESIGN PATTERNS APPLIED:
  • Active Record (Django ORM)  — Cart.item_count and Cart.subtotal are
    computed Python properties on the model, keeping aggregation logic
    close to the data rather than scattered across views.
  • Price Snapshot              — see PRICE SNAPSHOT section below.

PRICE SNAPSHOT DESIGN DECISION:
---------------------------------
CartItem.unit_price stores the price AT THE TIME the item was added to the
cart, not a FK to the current variant price.

WHY?  If a seller lowers the price of a T-shirt after a customer has already
added it to their cart, the customer should see the price they expected when
they added it — not a surprise change at checkout. The snapshot also protects
against accidental price increases wiping out in-flight checkout sessions.

This is a deliberate de-normalisation: we trade a small amount of storage
for price consistency and auditability.

STOCK RESERVATION (DB TRIGGER INTEGRATION):
  When a CartItem is created (INSERT), a database trigger increments
  Inventory.quantity_reserved for that variant. When it is deleted (DELETE),
  the trigger decrements it. This means "available stock" always reflects
  items in carts across ALL users — preventing overselling.

  The trigger is managed in the database migration, not in Python. This means
  the reservation happens atomically at the DB level regardless of which
  code path inserts/deletes cart items.

ONE-TO-ONE CART PER USER:
  Cart is a OneToOneField on User. A user can only have one active cart.
  CartService.get_or_create_cart() is the safe entry point — it creates
  the cart record lazily on first add-to-cart.

SAVE FOR LATER (soft partition of one cart):
  CartItem.saved_for_later splits a single cart into two logical lists —
  "active" (checkout) and "saved" — instead of introducing a second model.
  WHY a flag, not a new table? The two lists share every other field and the
  same stock-reservation trigger; a boolean keeps the schema and the DB
  triggers untouched. The Cart.item_count / Cart.subtotal properties and
  CartService (totals, coupon, place_order, clear_cart) all filter
  saved_for_later=False, so saved items never count toward checkout yet survive
  across orders. Moving an item back to the cart re-validates stock.
